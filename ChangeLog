* Version 1.0.0
 	- Adds AES key wrap functions
	- Adds AES GCM functions
* Version 0.4.2
	- Started this a bit late :(
	- Add wrapper functions for libsodium, which is a much better
	library and will call libsodium if available. In the obscure case
	where libsodium is not available, small core functions are used
	directly by yacl.
